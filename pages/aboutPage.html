            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>From an early age, I was captivated by the world of computers, endlessly curious about how they worked and what made them tick. This curiosity led me down a path of exploration and learning, where I eagerly absorbed everything I could about technology. My fascination extended beyond screens and keyboards to the physical world of puzzles and problem-solving. The Rubik's Cube, with its myriad algorithms and solutions, became a personal challenge that I loved to tackle. Each twist and turn was a puzzle to be solved, a new algorithm to master, and a demonstration of how complex problems could be broken down into manageable steps.</p>
            <p>Alongside my passion for computers and puzzles, I found joy in building with LEGOs, where creativity met engineering. Each LEGO set was a canvas, allowing me to construct intricate designs and structures, fostering a love for building and creating. This blend of interests – from coding and algorithms to hands-on projects and puzzles – has shaped my approach to problem-solving and innovation. It has driven me to pursue a career in computer science, where I can merge my analytical skills and creative thinking to develop solutions that are as functional as they are elegant.</p>

                Driven by my passion for computers and technology, I was determined to pursue a formal education in computer science. This led me to enroll at <a href="https://www.plmun.edu.ph/" target="_blank">Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun)</a>, where I could immerse myself in a curriculum that aligned perfectly with my interests. At PLMun, I delved deep into the core principles of computer science, from programming languages and software development to data structures and algorithms. The comprehensive education I received not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choosing PLMun was one of the best decisions I made for my academic and professional journey. The university provided an environment that encouraged exploration and innovation, allowing me to work on diverse projects and collaborate with talented peers and mentors. Each course and project further fueled my enthusiasm and solidified my commitment to the field. Graduating with a degree in computer science from PLMun has equipped me with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to embark on a career dedicated to leveraging technology to create meaningful solutions and drive progress in the digital age.

                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible hobbies I have are <a href="/projects/music">Music Production</a> and creating <a href="/projects/art">Digital Art</a>. You can read more about each of these on their respective pages under my projects tab. Some other hobbies I enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly) playing video games.
                </p>
                <p>In college, I was an active member in the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon and held multiple positions in the chapter. I met a lot of amazing people through my fraternity and thoroughly enjoyed the community.
