            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>From an early age, I was captivated by the world of computers, endlessly curious about how they worked and what made them tick. This curiosity led me down a path of exploration and learning, where I eagerly absorbed everything I could about technology. My fascination extended beyond screens and keyboards to the physical world of puzzles and problem-solving. The Rubik's Cube, with its myriad algorithms and solutions, became a personal challenge that I loved to tackle. Each twist and turn was a puzzle to be solved, a new algorithm to master, and a demonstration of how complex problems could be broken down into manageable steps.</p>
            <p>Alongside my passion for computers and puzzles, I found joy in building with LEGOs, where creativity met engineering. Each LEGO set was a canvas, allowing me to construct intricate designs and structures, fostering a love for building and creating. This blend of interests – from coding and algorithms to hands-on projects and puzzles – has shaped my approach to problem-solving and innovation. It has driven me to pursue a career in computer science, where I can merge my analytical skills and creative thinking to develop solutions that are as functional as they are elegant.</p>

                Driven by my passion for computers and technology, I was determined to pursue a formal education in computer science. This led me to enroll at <a href="https://www.plmun.edu.ph/" target="_blank">Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun)</a>, where I could immerse myself in a curriculum that aligned perfectly with my interests. At PLMun, I delved deep into the core principles of computer science, from programming languages and software development to data structures and algorithms. The comprehensive education I received not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choosing PLMun was one of the best decisions I made for my academic and professional journey. The university provided an environment that encouraged exploration and innovation, allowing me to work on diverse projects and collaborate with talented peers and mentors. Each course and project further fueled my enthusiasm and solidified my commitment to the field. Graduating with a degree in computer science from PLMun has equipped me with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to embark on a career dedicated to leveraging technology to create meaningful solutions and drive progress in the digital age.

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                In my free time, one of my favorite hobbies is riding motorcycles. The thrill of the open road and the sense of freedom that comes with each ride are unparalleled. Whether it's a short trip around the city or a long journey through scenic routes, motorcycling offers me a unique way to unwind and connect with the world around me. It's not just about the ride; it's about the adventure, the exploration, and the feeling of being one with the machine and the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another hobby I enjoy is playing the guitar. While I don't play every day, picking up the guitar and strumming a few chords provides a relaxing and creative outlet. Music has always been a part of my life, and the guitar, in particular, allows me to express my emotions and ideas in a different way. Whether I'm playing for myself or sharing music with friends, the guitar brings a sense of joy and fulfillment that complements my technical pursuits in computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have a passion for camping and the great outdoors. There's something incredibly refreshing about escaping the hustle and bustle of daily life and immersing myself in nature. Camping trips offer a perfect balance of adventure and tranquility, allowing me to disconnect from technology and reconnect with the natural world. Whether it's hiking through forests, setting up camp by a serene lake, or stargazing around a campfire, these experiences rejuvenate my mind and spirit, providing a much-needed break from the fast-paced world of development and technology.
